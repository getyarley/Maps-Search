# Maps-Search

This is a simple Apple Maps app to search for and save locations. The user can search for a specific location, the map will then scroll to the best match and will be displayed as a temporary MKPointAnnotation. The MKPointAnnotation can be selected, which will prompt the user to add "+" the location to their favorites for easy access later, as shown by the horizontal scroll view at the bottom of the screen. 

Alerts are used to inform the user of adding locations and request confirmation for deleting.
